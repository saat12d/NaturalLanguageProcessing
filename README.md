deep_learning_for_text.ipynb showcases multiple deep learning algorithms for NLP to classify an IMDB review as positive or negative. The different models used are - 
  1. Bag of Words (with Unigrams, Bigrams, and Bigrams with TF-IDF encoding)
  2. Sequence Models (with bidirectional LSTM and Embeddings)
  3. Transformers (with Positional Embedding)

seq2seq_models.ipynb showcases models for language translation from English to Spanish. The different models are - 
  1. RNN's (with GRU)
  2. Transformers (with Positional Embedding)
